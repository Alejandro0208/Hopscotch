    <h3>About the Piece</h3>

    <p>
        The theme of the piece is childhood. We hoped to recreate a unique version of the playful game that we often played<br>
        as children. The result was a finger-sized hopscotch game, where it lights up as the user's fingers press buttons <br>
        corresponding to the hopscotch squares.

    <br>

    <p>
        Because our buttons were relatively small, it was difficult to secure them while keeping them connected to the <br>
        wired to the breadboard. We solved this problem by using the wooden circles left over from laser cutting our <br>
        enclosure to act as tops for the buttons. To connect the buttons and wires, we soldered them. This proved to be <br>
        another issue, since we originally soldered the buttons in a way that didnâ€™t allow for the current to switch on and <br>
        off. We solved them by resoldering the wires. Making and assembling the box was both a difficult and entertaining <br>
        experience. The combination of laser cutting and using saws was something we had never done before.  
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        We decided to have lights exposed as opposed to keeping them within the enclosure in order to get as much color <br>
        as possible to stay true the vibrancy and playfulness of hopscotch. We also made it so the buttons are surrounded <br>
        by little laser cut squares to emulate the squares in hopscotch.

    <br>

    <h3>Setup</h3>

        Easily the most difficult part of recreating the projecting is actually building the enclosure. We recommend using <br>
        tape  to secure the lights and either tape or glue to hold the box together. Tops for the buttons is also key.
